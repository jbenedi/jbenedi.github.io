						<div class="title">Hi, I'm <bold>James</bold>!</div><br>
						<br>I am a university student currently studying Theatre Design and Production with a focus on lighting at Salisbury University! I've been learning about and studying theatrical lighting since my freshman year of high school, accumulating over six years of experience.
						<br><br>I currently have experience in over 20 productions, primarily in lighting, at various venues including my old high school, local theatre, university, and more. Each production has allowed me to grow my skills in designing, hanging, focusing, programming, and operating theatrical lighting!
						<br><br>My goal after university is to become a lighting designer primarily for theatrical productions, but I am also interested in concert and event lighting design.
						<br><br>In addition to theatrical lighting, some other interests I have are photography and coding. I love playing with lighting in my photography work as well, using color and shadows to convey emotion. You can see some of my photography in the photography tab above. 
						<br><br>I have also found enjoyment in coding, which has allowed me to grow my problem solving and creative design skills. I'm proud to say that I coded this website from scratch without the help of any website builders!
						<br><br>Feel free to download my resume by clicking the button below. I look forward to connecting and working with you!
